You should hear from at least one person.\n\nIn the following screen, you will be presented with several possible stakeholders. Each stakeholder that you choose to hear from will share their professional knowledge and opinions based on their individual perspective. Time is short, so be mindful of who is best positioned to fill in your understanding of the project and who will help you think critically about your assigned task.\n\nMake your selected on the next screen.";
